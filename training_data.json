A basic SQL fix for this can be found here:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://aspadvice.com/blogs/programming_shorts/archive/2008/06/27/Asprox-Recovery.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://aspadvice.com/blogs/programming_shorts/archive/2008/06/27/Asprox-Recovery.aspx</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The scary thing though is that the virus looks to the system tables for values to infect and a lot of shared hosting plans also share the database space for their clients. So most likely it wasn't even your dad's site that was infected, but somebody else's site within his hosting cluster that wrote some poor code and opened the door to SQL Injection attack.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If he hasn't done so yet, I'd send an URGENT e-mail to their host and give them a link to that SQL code to fix the entire system. You can fix your own affected database tables, but most likely the bots that are doing the infection are going to pass right through that hole again and infect the whole lot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hopefully this gives you some more info to work with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EDIT: One more quick thought, if he's using one of the hosts online design tools for building his website, all of that content is probably sitting in a column and was infected that way.</p>"}

It seems especially well suited for soloing, where you don't need or want a lot of complexity in that area.  </p>\n\n<p>By the way, if you want to keep track of what you're doing at the computer all day, check out TimeSprite, which integrates with FogBugz.  It's a Windows app that logs your active window and then categorizes your activity based on the window title / activity type mappings you define as you go.  (You can also just tell it what you're working on.)  And if you're a FogBugz user, you can associate your work with a FogBugz case, and it will upload your time intervals for that case.  This makes accurate recording of elapsed time pretty painless and about as accurate as you can get, which in turn improves FogBugz predictive powers in its evidence-based scheduling.  Also, when soloing, I find that such specific logging of my time keeps me on task, in the way a meandering manager otherwise might. (I'm not affiliated with TimeSprite in any way.)</p>\n"}

You'll have to see what, in particular, bounds the quality of your data.  Here are basic descriptions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Between any two points in your data, (x(0),y(0)) and (x(n),y(n)), add up y(i+1)-y(i) for 0 &lt;= i &lt; n and call this T (\"travel\") and set R (\"rise\") to y(n)- y(0) + k for suitably small k.  T/R > 1 indicates a peak.  This works OK if large travel due to noise is unlikely or if noise distributes symmetrically around a base curve shape.  For your application, accept the earliest peak with a score above a given threshold, or analyze the curve of travel per rise values for more interesting properties.</p></li>\n<li><p>Use matched filters to score similarity to a standard peak shape (essentially, use a normalized dot-product against some shape to get a cosine-metric of similarity)</p></li>\n<li><p>Deconvolve against a standard peak shape and check for high values (though I often find 2 to be less sensitive to noise for simple instrumentation output).</p></li>\n<li><p>Smooth the data and check for triplets of equally spaced points where, if x0 &lt; x1 &lt; x2, y1 > 0.5*(y0+y2), or check Euclidean distances like this:  D((x0,y0),(x1,y1)) + D((x1,y1),(x2,y2)) > D((x0,y0),(x2,y2)), which relies on the triangle inequality.  Using simple ratios will again provide you a scoring mechanism.</p></li>\n<li><p>Fit a very simple 2-gaussian mixture model to your data (for example, Numerical Recipes has a nice ready-made chunk of code).  Take the earlier peak.  This will deal correctly with overlapping peaks.</p></li>\n<li><p>Find the best match in the data to a simple Gaussian, Cauchy, Poisson, or what-have-you curve.  Evaluate this curve over a broad range and subtract it from a copy of the data after noting it's peak location.  Repeat.  Take the earliest peak whose model parameters (standard deviation probably, but some applications might care about kurtosis or other features) meet some criterion.  Watch out for artifacts left behind when peaks are subtracted from the data.\nBest match might be determined by the kind of match scoring suggested in #2 above.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I've done what you're doing before:  finding peaks in DNA sequence data, finding peaks in derivatives estimated from measured curves, and finding peaks in histograms.</p>\n\n<p>I encourage you to attend carefully to proper baselining.  Wiener filtering or other filtering or simple histogram analysis is often an easy way to baseline in the presence of noise.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, if your data is typically noisy and you're getting data off the card as unreferenced single-ended output (or even referenced, just not differential), and if you're averaging lots of observations into each data point, try sorting those observations and throwing away the first and last quartile and averaging what remains.  There are a host of such outlier elimination tactics that can be really useful.</p>\n"}

I was using PMD for a little while before I noticed the <a href=\"http://pmd.sourceforge.net/cpd.html\">\"Finding Duplicated Code\" link</a> on the <a href=\"http://pmd.sourceforge.net\">PMD web page</a>.</p>\n\n<p><p>I'd like to point out that these tools can sometimes be extended beyond their \"out-of-the-box\" set of rules. And not just because they're open source so that you can rewrite them. Some of these tools come with applications or \"hooks\" that allow them to be extended. For example, PMD comes with the <a href=\"http://pmd.sourceforge.net/howtowritearule.html\">\"designer\" tool</a> that allows you to create new rules. Also, Checkstyle has the <a href=\"http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/config_misc.html#DescendantToken\">DescendantToken</a> check that has properties that allow for substantial customization.</p>\n\n<p><p>I integrate these tools with <a href=\"http://virtualteamtls.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/virtualteamtls/trunk/scm/common.xml?view=markup\">an Ant-based build</a>. You can follow the link to see my commented configuration.</p>\n\n<p><p>In addition to the simple integration into the build, I find it helpful to configure the tools to be somewhat \"integrated\" in a couple of other ways. Namely, report generation and warning suppression uniformity. I'd like to add these aspects to this discussion (which should probably have the \"static-analysis\" tag also): how are folks configuring these tools to create a \"unified\" solution? (I've asked this question separately <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/79918/configuring-static-analysis-tools-for-uniformity\">here</a>)</p>\n\n<p><p>First, for warning reports, I transform the output so that each warning has the simple format:</p>\n\n<pre><code>/absolute-path/filename:line-number:column-number: warning(tool-name): message</code></pre>\n\n<p><p>This is often called the \"Emacs format,\" but even if you aren't using Emacs, it's a reasonable format for homogenizing reports. For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>/project/src/com/example/Foo.java:425:9: warning(Checkstyle):Missing a Javadoc comment.</code></pre>\n\n<p><p>My warning format transformations are done by my Ant script with Ant <a href=\"http://ant.apache.org/manual/Types/filterchain.html\">filterchains</a>.</p>\n\n<p><p>The second \"integration\" that I do is for warning suppression. By default, each tool supports comments or an annotation (or both) that you can place in your code to silence a warning that you want to ignore. But these various warning suppression requests do not have a consistent look which seems somewhat silly. When you're suppressing a warning, you're suppressing a warning, so why not always write \"<code>SuppressWarning</code>?\"</p>\n\n<p><p>For example, PMD's default configuration suppresses warning generation on lines of code with the string \"<code>NOPMD</code>\" in a comment. Also, PMD supports Java's <code>@SuppressWarnings</code> annotation. I configure PMD to use comments containing \"<code>SuppressWarning(PMD.</code>\" instead of <code>NOPMD</code> so that PMD suppressions look alike. I fill in the particular rule that is violated when using the comment style suppression:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// SuppressWarnings(PMD.PreserveStackTrace) justification: (false positive) exceptions are chained</code></pre>\n\n<p><p>Only the \"<code>SuppressWarnings(PMD.</code>\" part is significant for a comment, but it is consistent with PMD's support for the <code>@SuppressWarning</code> annotation which does recognize individual rule violations by name:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@SuppressWarnings(\"PMD.CompareObjectsWithEquals\") // justification: identity comparision intended</code></pre>\n\n<p><p>Similarly, Checkstyle suppresses warning generation between pairs of comments (no annotation support is provided). By default, comments to turn Checkstyle off and on contain the strings <code>CHECKSTYLE:OFF</code> and <code>CHECKSTYLE:ON</code>, respectively. Changing this configuration (with Checkstyle's \"SuppressionCommentFilter\") to use the strings \"<code>BEGIN&nbsp;SuppressWarnings(CheckStyle.</code>\" and \"<code>END&nbsp;SuppressWarnings(CheckStyle.</code>\" makes the controls look more like PMD:</p>\n\n<pre>\n<code>// BEGIN SuppressWarnings(Checkstyle.HiddenField) justification: \"Effective Java,\" 2nd ed., Bloch, Item 2</code>\n<code>// END SuppressWarnings(Checkstyle.HiddenField)</code>\n</pre>\n\n<p><p>With Checkstyle comments, the particular check violation (<code>HiddenField</code>) <em>is</em> significant because each check has its own \"<code>BEGIN/END</code>\" comment pair.</p>\n\n<p><p>FindBugs also supports warning generation suppression with a <code>@SuppressWarnings</code> annotation, so no further configuration is required to achieve some level of uniformity with other tools. Unfortunately, Findbugs has to support a custom <code>@SuppressWarnings</code> annotation because the built-in Java <code>@SuppressWarnings</code> annotation has a <code>SOURCE</code> retention policy which is not strong enough to retain the annotation in the class file where FindBugs needs it. I fully qualify FindBugs warnings suppressions to avoid clashing with Java's <code>@SuppressWarnings</code> annotation:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@edu.umd.cs.findbugs.annotations.SuppressWarnings(\"UWF&#95;FIELD&#95;NOT&#95;INITIALIZED&#95;IN&#95;CONSTRUCTOR\")</code></pre>\n\n<p><p>These techniques makes things look reasonably consistent across tools. Note that having each warning suppression contain the string \"<code>SuppressWarnings</code>\" makes it easy to run a simple search to find all instances for all tools over an entire code base.</p>\n"}

The best thing to do when trying to tune queries/indexes is to use the Query Plan Analyzer and SQL Profiler in SQL Server.  This will show you where you are running into costly table scans or other performance blockers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for the GUID vs ID argument, you can find people online that swear by both.  I have always been taught to use GUIDs unless I have a really good reason not to.  Jeff has a good post that talks about the reasons for using GUIDs: <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000817.html\">http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000817.html</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As with most anything development related, if you are looking to improve performance there is not one, single right answer.  It really depends on what you are trying to accomplish and how you are implementing the solution.  The only true answer is to test, test, and test again against performance metrics to ensure that you are meeting your goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Edit]\r\n@Matt, after doing some more research on the GUID/ID debate I came across this post.  Like I mentioned before, there is not a true right or wrong answer.  It depends on your specific implementation needs.  But these are some pretty valid reasons to use GUIDs as the primary key:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  <p>For example, there is an issue known as a \"hotspot\", where certain pages of data in a table are under relatively high currency contention. Basically, what happens is most of the traffic on a table (and hence page-level locks) occurs on a small area of the table, towards the end. New records will always go to this hotspot, because IDENTITY is a sequential number generator. These inserts are troublesome because they require Exlusive page lock on the page they are added to (the hotspot). This effectively serializes all inserts to a table thanks to the page locking mechanism. NewID() on the other hand does not suffer from hotspots. Values generated using the NewID() function are only sequential for short bursts of inserts (where the function is being called very quickly, such as during a multi-row insert), which causes the inserted rows to spread randomly throughout the table's data pages instead of all at the end - thus eliminating a hotspot from inserts.</p>\r\n  \r\n  <p>Also, because the inserts are randomly distributed, the chance of page splits is greatly reduced. While a page split here and there isnt too bad, the effects do add up quickly. With IDENTITY, page Fill Factor is pretty useless as a tuning mechanism and might as well be set to 100% - rows will never be inserted in any page but the last one. With NewID(), you can actually make use of Fill Factor as a performance-enabling tool. You can set Fill Factor to a level that approximates estimated volume growth between index rebuilds, and then schedule the rebuilds during off-peak hours using dbcc reindex. This effectively delays the performance hits of page splits until off-peak times.</p>\r\n  \r\n  <p>If you even <em>think</em> you might need to enable replication for the table in question - then you might as well make the PK a uniqueidentifier and flag the guid field as ROWGUIDCOL. Replication will require a uniquely valued guid field with this attribute, and it will add one if none exists. If a suitable field exists, then it will just use the one thats there.</p>\r\n  \r\n  <p>Yet another huge benefit for using GUIDs for PKs is the fact that the value is indeed guaranteed unique - not just among all values generated by <em>this</em> server, but all values generated by <em>all</em> computers - whether it be your db server, web server, app server, or client machine. Pretty much every modern language has the capability of generating a valid guid now - in .NET you can use System.Guid.NewGuid. This is VERY handy when dealing with cached master-detail datasets in particular. You dont have to employ crazy temporary keying schemes just to relate your records together before they are committed. You just fetch a perfectly valid new Guid from the operating system for each new record's permanent key value at the time the record is created. </p>\r\n  \r\n  <p><a href=\"http://forums.asp.net/t/264350.aspx\">http://forums.asp.net/t/264350.aspx</a></p>\r\n</blockquote>"}

This means you will need a collection to hold references to the threads you started:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Start all of the threads.\nList&lt;Thread&gt; startedThreads = new List&lt;Thread&gt;();\nforeach (...) {\n  Thread thread = new Thread(new ThreadStart(MyMethod));\n  thread.Start();\n  startedThreads.Add(thread);\n}\n\n// Wait for all of the threads to finish.\nforeach (Thread thread in startedThreads) {\n  thread.Join();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In contrast, if you called Join inside the loop, the result would basically be the same as not using threads at all. Each iteration of the loop body would create and start a thread but then immediately Join it and wait for it to finish.</p>\n\n<p>If the individual threads produce some result (write a message in a log, for example) then the messages may still appear out of order because there's no coordination between the threads. It is possible to get the threads to output their results in order by coordinating them with a Monitor.</p>\n"}

{"prompt": "<p>The company I'm currently working for is using <a href=\"http://selenium.openqa.org/\">Selenium</a> for Uniting-Testing our User Interface. What do you use to Unit-Test your Web UI and how effective do you find it? </p>\n", "completion": "<p>I'm a huge fan of Selenium. Saying 'unit-testing your web ui' isn't exactly accurate as some of the comments have mentioned. However, I do find Selenium to be incredibly useful for performing those sort of acceptance and sanity tests on the UI.</p>\n\n<p>A good way to get started is using Selenium IDE as part of your development. Ie, just have the IDE open as you're developing and write your test as you go to cut down on your dev time. (Instead of having to manually go through the UI to get to the point where you can test whatever you're working on, just hit a button and Selenium IDE will take care of that for you. It's a terrific time-saver!)</p>\n\n<p>Most of my major use case scenarios have Selenium RC tests to back them up. You can't really think of them as unit-tests along the lines of an xUnit framework, but they are tests targetted to very specific functionality. They're quick to write (especially if you implement common methods for things like logging in or setting up your test cases), quick to run, and provide a very tight feedback loop. In those senses Selenium RC tests are very <em>similar</em> to unit-tests.</p>\n\n<p>I think, like anything else, if you put the effort into properly learning a test tool (eg, Selenium), your effort will pay off in spades. You mention that your company already uses Selenium to do UI testing. This is great. Work with it. If you find Selenium hard to use, or confusing, stick with it. The learning curve really isn't all that steep once you learn the API a little bit.</p>\n\n<p>If I'm working on a web app, its rare for me to write a significant amount of code without Selenium RC tests to back it up.

However, you're concerned about polluting your domain model with the 'plumbing' code that would be necessary to read and write to your object's fields.</p>\n\n<p>Taking a step back, you essentially have two choices of where to put your data mapping code - within the domain class itself or in an external mapping class.\nThe first option is often called the Active Record pattern and has the advantage that each object knows how to persist itself and has sufficient access to its internal structure to allow it to perform the mapping without needing to expose non-business related fields.</p>\n\n<p>E.g</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class User\n{\n\tprivate string name;\n\tprivate AccountStatus status;\n\n\tprivate User()\n\t{\n\t}\n\n\tpublic string Name\n\t{\n\t\tget { return name; }\n\t\tset { name = value; }\n\t}\n\n\tpublic AccountStatus Status\n\t{\n\t\tget { return status; }\n\t}\n\n\tpublic void Activate()\n\t{\n\t\tstatus = AccountStatus.Active;\n\t}\n\n\tpublic void Suspend()\n\t{\n\t\tstatus = AccountStatus.Suspended;\n\t}\n\n\tpublic static User GetById(int id)\n\t{\n\t\tUser fetchedUser = new User();\n\n\t\t// Lots of database and error-checking code\n\t\t// omitted for clarity\n\t\t// ...\n\n\t\tfetchedUser.name = (string) reader[\"Name\"];\n\t\tfetchedUser.status = (int)reader[\"statusCode\"] == 0 ? AccountStatus.Suspended : AccountStatus.Active;\n\n\t\treturn fetchedUser;\n\t}\n\n\tpublic static void Save(User user)\n\t{\n\t\t// Code to save User's internal structure to database\n\t\t// ...\n\t}\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In this example, we have an object that represents a User with a Name and an AccountStatus. We don't want to allow the Status to be set directly, perhaps because we want to check that the change is a valid status transition, so we don't have a setter. Fortunately, the mapping code in the GetById and Save static methods have full access to the object's name and status fields.</p>\n\n<p>The second option is to have a second class that is responsible for the mapping. This has the advantage of seperating out the different concerns of business logic and persistence which can allow your design to be more testable and flexible. The challenge with this method is how to expose the name and status fields to the external class. Some options are:\n  1. Use reflection (which has no qualms about digging deep into your object's private parts)\n  2. Provide specially-named, public setters (e.g. prefix them with the word 'Private') and hope no one uses them accidentally\n  3. If your language suports it, make the setters internal but grant your data mapper module access. E.g. use the InternalsVisibleToAttribute in .NET 2.0 onwards or friend functions in C++</p>\n\n<p>For more information, I'd recommend Martin Fowler's classic book 'Patterns of Enterprise Architecture'</p>\n\n<p>However, as a word of warning, before going down the path of writing your own mappers I'd strongly recommend looking at using a 3rd-party object relational mapper (ORM) tool such as nHibernate or Microsoft's Entity Framework. I've worked on four different projects where, for various reasons, we wrote our own mapper and it is very easy to waste a lot of time maintaining and extending the mapper instead of writing code that provides end user value. I've used nHibernate on one project so far and, although it has quite a steep learning curve initially, the investment you put in early on pays off considerably.</p>\n"}

The following function (<code>print</code>) is an example of a function which could be passed to <code>func</code> as a parameter because it is the proper type:</p>\n\n<pre><code>void print ( int x ) {\n  printf(\"%d\\n\", x);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Function Call</strong></p>\n\n<p>When calling a function with a function parameter, the value passed must be a pointer to a function.

If reversing the \"ON\" bits means reversing only the bits that are \"ON\", then you will always get 0, no matter what the input is.  If it means reversing <em>all</em> the bits, i.e. changing all 1s to 0s and all 0s to 1s, which is how I initially read it, then that's just a bitwise NOT, or complement.  C-based languages have a complement operator, <code>~</code>, that does this.

For example, to create\n  a new instance of Excel using late binding:</p>\n\n<pre><code> Dim oXL As Object\n Set oXL = CreateObject(\"Excel.Application\")\n</code></pre>\n  \n  <p>On the other hand, to manipulate an existing instance of Excel (if\n  Excel is already open) you would use GetObject (regardless whether\n  you're using early or late binding):</p>\n\n<pre><code> Dim oXL As Object\n Set oXL = GetObject(, \"Excel.Application\")\n</code></pre>\n  \n  <p>To use early binding, you first need to set a reference in your\n  project to the application you want to manipulate. In the VB Editor of\n  any Office application, or in VB itself, you do this by selecting\n  Tools + References, and selecting the application you want from the\n  list (e.g. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cMicrosoft Excel 8.0 Object Library\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d).</p>\n  \n  <p>To create a new instance of Excel using early binding:</p>\n\n<pre><code> Dim oXL As Excel.Application\n Set oXL = New Excel.Application\n</code></pre>\n  \n  <p>In either case, incidentally, you can first try to get an existing\n  instance of Excel, and if that returns an error, you can create a new\n  instance in your error handler.</p>\n</blockquote>\n"}
{"prompt": "<p>What is the difference between early and late binding?</p>\n", "completion": "<p>In compiled languages, the difference is stark.</p>\n\n<p>Java:</p>\n\n<pre><code>//early binding:\npublic create_a_foo(*args) {\n return new Foo(args)\n}\nmy_foo = create_a_foo();\n\n//late binding:\npublic create_something(Class klass, *args) {\n  klass.new_instance(args)\n}\nmy_foo = create_something(Foo);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the first example, the compiler can do all sorts of neat stuff at compile time.  In the second, you just have to hope that whoever uses the method does so responsibly.  (Of course, newer JVMs support the <code>Class&lt;? extends Foo&gt; klass</code> structure, which can greatly reduce this risk.)</p>\n\n<p>Another benefit is that IDEs can hotlink to the class definition, since it's declared right there in the method.  The call to create<em>something(Foo) might be _very</em> far from the method definition, and if you're looking at the method definition, it might be nice to see the implementation.</p>\n\n<p>The major advantage of late binding is that it makes things like inversion-of-control easier, as well as certain other uses of polymorphism and duck-typing (if your language supports such things).</p>\n"}

The growth of JRuby means that more Ruby is compiled these days, though, making it act more like Java, above.</p>\n\n<p>The issue with IDEs still stands: a platform like Eclipse can look up class definitions if you hard-code them, but cannot if you leave them up to the caller.</p>\n\n<p>Inversion-of-control is not terribly popular in Ruby, probably because of its extreme runtime flexibility, but Rails makes great use of late binding to reduce the amount of configuration necessary to get your application going.</p>\n"}

Some sample applications might be:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Robust storage of a modest amount of data with modest traffic (such as a home network with various por^H^H^Hmedia files on it): One mirrored pair (RAID 1) of disks that are separate from the system disk of the machine they are installed in.  This will allow you to rebuild the machine or perform major surgery without affecting the data volume.  RAID-1 means that the data will survive the failure of a single disk.</li>\n<li>A video editing sytem that needs fast streaming but not necessarily 100% reliability: a direct-attach RAID-0 (striped) on fibre channel disks with 'V' firmware (a seagate-ism but they make most such parts).  Fibre channel is a packet based protocol whereas with SCSI two devices book out the whole bus.  FC works better under load.</li>\n<li>Trnsactional application: Logs on a mirrored pair and data on one or more RAID-5/6, RAID-10 or RAID-50/60 volumes.  On a SAN or any controller configuration with battery-backed write back caching the controller can optimise the disk writes.  DB logs are mostly sequential access whereas the data volumes are mostly random access.  The random seek activity will disturb the logging activity so you will get a performance gain from keeping the logging disks relatively quiet and free from competing traffic.</li>\n<li>Large data warehouse fact table: A series of mirrored pairs (RAID 1) on JBODs with as many host channels into the server as you can afford.  Spread the fact table partitions across the mirrored pairs.  Striped disks with typical array firmware setup will often only get you one (say) 64k stripe per revolution of the disk, which comes to maybe 5 or 10MB/sec per disk on a 10K drive.  DW workloads have a more streaming data access pattern than a transactional application.  Using the mirrored pairs means that the disks can potentially stream data at something more like their maximum data transfer rate.  This can be an order of magnitude faster.  </li>\n</ul>\n"}

If you just have one or two queries that are problems, a manual approach is probably appropriate, whereas some sort of data warehousing tool might be better for creating a platform to develop data cubes.</p>\n\n<p>Here's a site I found that touches on the subject:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.meansandends.com/mysql-data-warehouse/?link_body%2Fbody=%7Bincl%3AAggregation%7D\"><a href=\"http://www.meansandends.com/mysql-data-warehouse/?link_body%2Fbody=%7Bincl%3AAggregation%7D\">http://www.meansandends.com/mysql-data-warehouse/?link_body%2Fbody=%7Bincl%3AAggregation%7D</a></a></p>\n\n<p>Here's a simple technique that you can use to keep denormalizing queries simple, if you're just doing a few at a time (and I'm not replacing your OLTP tables, just creating a new one for reporting purposes).  Let's say you have this query in your application:</p>\n\n<pre><code>select a.name, b.address from tbla a \njoin tblb b on b.fk_a_id = a.id where a.id=1\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You could create a denormalized table and populate with almost the same query:</p>\n\n<pre><code>create table tbl_ab (a_id, a_name, b_address); \n-- (types elided)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Notice the underscores match the table aliases you use</p>\n\n<pre><code>insert tbl_ab select a.id, a.name, b.address from tbla a\njoin tblb b on b.fk_a_id = a.id \n-- no where clause because you want everything\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then to fix your app to use the new denormalized table, switch the dots for underscores.  </p>\n\n<pre><code>select a_name as name, b_address as address \nfrom tbl_ab where a_id = 1;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For huge queries this can save a lot of time and makes it clear where the data came from, and you can re-use the queries you already have.</p>\n\n<p>Remember, I'm only advocating this as the last resort.  I bet there's a few indexes that would help you.  And when you de-normalize, don't forget to account for the extra space on your disks, and figure out when you will run the query to populate the new tables.  This should probably be at night, or whenever activity is low.  And the data in that table, of course, will never exactly be up to date.</p>\n\n<p>[Yet another edit]  Don't forget that the new tables you create need to be indexed too!  The good part is that you can index to your heart's content and not worry about update lock contention, since aside from your bulk insert the table will only see selects.</p>\n"}

For example, if you are reporting on order numbers over date ranges, a composite index on the order number and order date columns could help. I believe MySQL can only use one index for the query so if you just had separate indexes on the order number and order date it would have to decide on just one of them to use. Using the EXPLAIN command can help determine this.</p>\n\n<p>To give an indication of the performance with good indexes (including numerous composite indexes), i can run queries joining 3 tables in our database and get almost instant results in most cases. For more complex reporting most of the queries run in under 10 seconds. These 3 tables have 33 million, 110 million and 140 millions rows respectively. Note that we had also already normalised these slightly to speed up our most common query on the database.</p>\n\n<p>More information regarding your tables and the types of reporting queries may allow further suggestions.</p>\n"}

This just allows you to know exactly what your code looked like at that point in time.</p>\n\n<p>The branches folder holds different kinds of branches that you might need in special situations. Sometimes a branch is a place to work on experimental feature or features that might take a long time to get stable (therefore you don't want to introduce them into your main line just yet).

(That narrows the field <em>a lot</em> if you care to guess the company.)  I know Joel's opinion, and my experience leads me to partially disagree: for the same reason that a \"white hat\" hacker is more effective finding security holes, certain kinds of errors are more effectively found by white box testers who know how to write code (and therefore what the common mistakes are - for example, resource management issues like memory leaks).  </p>\n\n<p>Also, since QA-oriented developers are part of the process from the initial design phase, they can theoretically help to drive higher-quality code throughout the process.  Ideally, for each developer working on the project with a mental focus on functionality, you have an opposing developer with a mental focus on breaking the code (and thus making it better).  </p>\n\n<p>Seen in that light, it's less a matter of using developers for testers than it is kind of disconnected pair-programming where one developer has an emphasis on controlling quality.  </p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, a lot of testing (such as basic UI functionality) frankly doesn't need that kind of skill.  That's where Joel has a point. </p>\n\n<p>For many businesses, I could see a system where programming teams trade off code review and testing duties for each others' code.  Members of the Business Logic team, for example, could spend an occasional tour testing and reviewing code for the UI team, and vice-versa.  That way you're not \"wasting\" developer talent on full-time testing, but you are gaining the advantages of exposing the code to (hopefully) expert scrutiny and punishment.

If you have a highly paid dev team and hack testers, you will probably find a lot of the big obvious issues, but you'll miss a lot of the more obscure bugs that will come back to haunt you later.</p>\n\n<p>So, I suppose the answer to your question is that testers should test as much as you want them to. You can fire all of your testers and have the developers do all of the testing, or you can hire an army of testers and let the developers check in whatever they want.</p>\n"}

This abstraction also allows the framework to add additional improvements that you can easily take advantage of.  <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163329.aspx\">PLINQ</a> is an example of adding multi-threading support to LINQ.  Code changes are minimal to add this support.  It would be MUCH harder to do this data access code that simply calls sprocs.</li>\n<li><strong>Debugging support</strong>: I can use any .NET debugger to debug the queries.  With sprocs, you cannot easily debug the SQL and that experience is largely tied to your database vendor (MS SQL Server provides a query analyzer, but often that isn't enough).</li>\n<li><strong>Vendor agnostic</strong>: LINQ works with lots of databases and the number of supported databases will only increase.  Sprocs are not always portable between databases, either because of varying syntax or feature support (if the database supports sprocs at all).</li>\n<li><strong>Deployment</strong>: Others have mentioned this already, but it's easier to deploy a single assembly than to deploy a set of sprocs.  This also ties in with #4.</li>\n<li><strong>Easier</strong>: You don't have to learn T-SQL to do data access, nor do you have to learn the data access API (e.g. ADO.NET) necessary for calling the sprocs.  This is related to #3 and #4.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Some disadvantages of LINQ vs sprocs:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Network traffic</strong>: sprocs need only serialize sproc-name and argument data over the wire while LINQ sends the entire query.  This can get really bad if the queries are very complex.  However, LINQ's abstraction allows Microsoft to improve this over time.</li>\n<li><strong>Less flexible</strong>: Sprocs can take full advantage of a database's featureset.  LINQ tends to be more generic in it's support.  This is common in any kind of language abstraction (e.g. C# vs assembler).</li>\n<li><strong>Recompiling</strong>: If you need to make changes to the way you do data access, you need to recompile, version, and redeploy your assembly.  Sprocs can <em>sometimes</em> allow a DBA to tune the data access routine without a need to redeploy anything.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Security and manageability are something that people argue about too.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Security</strong>: For example, you can protect your sensitive data by restricting access to the tables directly, and put ACLs on the sprocs.  With LINQ, however, you can still restrict direct access  to tables and instead put ACLs on updatable table <em>views</em> to achieve a similar end (assuming your database supports updatable views).  </li>\n<li><strong>Manageability</strong>: Using views also gives you the advantage of shielding your application non-breaking from schema changes (like table normalization).  You can update the view without requiring your data access code to change.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I used to be a big sproc guy, but I'm starting to lean towards LINQ as a better alternative in general.  If there are some areas where sprocs are clearly better, then I'll probably still write a sproc but access it using LINQ. :)</p>\n"}

{"prompt": "<p>First off I understand that it is a horrible idea to run extremely large/long running reports. I am aware that Microsoft has a rule of thumb stating that a SSRS report should take no longer than 30 seconds to execute.  However sometimes gargantuan reports are a preferred evil due to external forces such complying with state laws.</p>\n\n<p>At my place of employment, we have an asp.net (2.0) app that we have migrated from Crystal Reports to SSRS. Due to the large user base and complex reporting UI requirements we have a set of screens that accepts user inputted parameters and creates schedules to be run over night. Since the application supports multiple reporting frameworks we do not use the scheduling/snapshot facilities of SSRS. All of the reports in the system are generated by a scheduled console app which takes user entered parameters and generates the reports with the corresponding reporting solutions the reports were created with. In the case of SSRS reports, the console app generates the SSRS reports and exports them as PDFs via the SSRS web service API. </p>\n\n<p>So far SSRS has been much easier to deal with than Crystal with the exception of a certain 25,000 page report that we have recently converted from crystal reports to SSRS. The SSRS server is a 64bit 2003 server with 32 gigs of ram running SSRS 2005. All of our smaller reports work fantastically, but we are having trouble with our larger reports such as this one.  Unfortunately, we can't seem to generate the aforemention report through the web service API. The following error occurs roughly 30-35 minutes into the generation/export:</p>\n\n<p>Exception Message: The underlying connection was closed: An unexpected error occurred on a receive.</p>\n\n<p>The web service call is something I'm sure you all have seen before:  </p>\n\n<pre><code>data = rs.Render(this.ReportPath, this.ExportFormat, null, deviceInfo,\n   selectedParameters, null, null, out encoding, out mimeType, out usedParameters, \n   out warnings, out streamIds);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The odd thing is that this report will run/render/export if the report is run directly on the reporting server using the report manager. The proc that produces the data for the report runs for about 5 minutes. The report renders in SSRS native format in the browser/viewer after about 12 minutes. Exporting to pdf through the browser/viewer in the report manager takes an additional 55 minutes. This works reliably and it produces a whopping 1.03gb pdf.</p>\n\n<p>Here are some of the more obvious things I've tried to get the report working via the web service API:  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>set the HttpRuntime ExecutionTimeout\nvalue to 3 hours on the report\nserver</li>\n<li>disabled http keep alives on the report server</li>\n<li>increased the script timeout on the report server</li>\n<li>set the report to never time out on the server</li>\n<li>set the report timeout to several hours on the client call  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>From the tweaks I have tried, I am fairly comfortable saying that any timeout issues have been eliminated. </p>\n\n<p>Based off of my research of the error message, I believe that the web service API does not send chunked responses by default. This means that it tries to send all 1.3gb over the wire in one response. At a certain point, IIS throws in the towel. Unfortunately the API abstracts away web service configuration so I can't seem to find a way to enable response chunking. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Does anyone know of anyway to reduce/optimize the PDF export phase and or the size of the PDF without lowering the total page count?</li>\n<li>Is there a way to turn on response chunking for SSRS?</li>\n<li>Does anyone else have any other theories as to why this runs on the server but not through the API?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>EDIT: After reading kcrumley's post I began to take a look at the average page size by taking file size / page count. Interestingly enough on smaller reports the math works out so that each page is roughly 5K. Interestingly, when the report gets larger this \"average\" increases. An 8000 page report for example is averaging over 40K/page. Very odd. I will also add that the number of records per page is set except for the last page in each grouping, so it's not a case where some pages have more records than another. </p>\n", "completion": "<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n  <li>Does anyone know of anyway to\n  reduce/optimize the PDF export phase\n  and or the size of the PDF without\n  lowering the total page count?</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have a few ideas and questions:<br />\n1. Is this a graphics-heavy report?  If not, do you have tables that start out as text but are converted into a graphic by the SSRS PDF renderer (check if you can select the text in the PDF)?  41K per page might be more than it should be, or it might not, depending on how information-dense your report is.  But we've had cases where we had minor issues with a report's layout, like having a table bleed into the page's margins, that resulted in the SSRS PDF renderer \"throwing up its hands\" and rendering the table as an image instead of as text.  Obviously, the fewer graphics in your report, the smaller your file size will be.<br />\n2. Is there a way that you could easily break the report into pieces?  E.g., if it's a 10-location report, where Location 1 is followed by Location 2, etc., on your final report, could you run the Location 1 portion independent of the Location 2 portion, etc.?  If so, you could join the 10 sub-reports into one final PDF using <a href=\"http://pdfsharp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">PDFSharp</a> after you've received them all.  This leads to some difficulties with page numbering, but nothing insurmountable.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>3. Does anyone else have any other\n  theories as to why this runs on the\n  server but not through the API?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My guess would be the sheer size of the report.  I don't remember everything about what's an IIS setting and what's SSRS-specific, but there might be some overall IIS settings (maybe in Metabase.xml) that you would have to be updated to even allow that much data to pass through. </p>\n\n<p>You could isolate the question of whether the time is the problem by taking one of your working reports and building in a long wait time in your stored procedures with WAITFOR (assuming SQL Server for your DBMS).</p>\n\n<p>Not solutions, per se, but ideas.  Hope it helps.</p>\n"}

In its simplest form you make a single OSGi bundle out of your entire application. Clearly this is not a best practice but it can be useful to get a feel for deploying a bundle in an OSGi container (Equinox, Felix, Knoplerfish, etc).</p>\n\n<p>To take it to the next level you'll want to start splitting your app into components, components should typically have a set of responsibilities that can be isolated from the rest of your application through a set of interfaces and class dependencies. Identifying these purely by hand can range from rather straightforward for a well designed highly cohesive but loosely coupled application to a nightmare for interlocked source code that you are not familiar with.</p>\n\n<p>Some help can come from tools like <a href=\"http://clarkware.com/software/JDepend.html\">JDepend</a> which can show you the coupling of Java packages against other packages/classes in your system. A package with low efferent coupling should be easier to extract into an OSGi bundle than one with high efferent coupling.

In my experience, the one-object-to-one-row approach creates a much more fluid and literate presentation in code.  Also, I like to treat objects as records and the class as the table.

That answer involved SMB connections, not SQL.  However it was identical in that it involved a low-level transport error.</p>\n\n<p>What we found was that in a heavy load situation, it was fairly easy for the remote server to time out connections <em>at the TCP layer</em> simply because the server was busy.  Part of the reason was the defaults for how many times TCP will retransmit data on Windows weren't appropriate for our situation.</p>\n\n<p>Take a look at the <a href=\"http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314053\">registry settings for tuning TCP/IP</a> on Windows.  In particular you want to look at <strong>TcpMaxDataRetransmissions</strong> and maybe <strong>TcpMaxConnectRetransmissions</strong>.  These default to 5 and 2 respectively, try upping them a little bit on the client system and duplicate the load situation.</p>\n\n<p>Don't go crazy!  TCP doubles the timeout with each successive retransmission, so the timeout behavior for bad connections can go exponential on you if you increase these too much.  As I recall upping <strong>TcpMaxDataRetransmissions</strong> to 6 or 7 solved our problem in the vast majority of cases.</p>\n"}

Alternatively, you can also place the <strong>glew32.dll</strong> in a directory where Windows picks up its DLLs.</p>\n\n<p>Add the GLEW <strong>include</strong> path to your compiler's include directory list.</p>\n\n<p>Add the GLEW <strong>lib</strong> path to your compiler's library directory list.</p>\n\n<p>Instruct your compiler to use <strong>glew32.lib</strong> during linking. If you're using Visual C++ compilers then one way to do this is by adding the following line to your code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#pragma comment(lib, \"glew32.lib\")\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Add a <code>#include &lt;GL/glew.h&gt;</code> line to your code. Ensure that this is placed above the includes of other GL header files. (You may actually not need the GL header files includes if you include <code>glew.h</code>.)</p>\n\n<p>Initialize GLEW using <code>glewInit()</code> after you've initialized GLUT or GL. If it fails, then something is wrong with your setup.</p>\n\n<pre><code>if (GLEW_OK != glewInit())\n{\n    // GLEW failed!\n    exit(1);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Check if the extension(s) you wish to use are now available through GLEW. You do this by checking a boolean variable named <strong>GLEW<em>_your_extension_name</em></strong> which is exposed by GLEW.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Example:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<pre><code>if (!GLEW_EXT_framebuffer_object)\n{\n    exit(1);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That's it!

If the evaluation comes back with flying colors, you should start on your testing and QA and get ready to ship.</p>\n\n<p>If your evaluation comes back with a report highlighting features that are missing or differ significantly in their semantics in Mono you will have to evaluate whether the code can be adapted, rewritten or in the worst case whether your application can work with reduced functionality.      </p>\n\n<p>According to our Moma statistics based on user submissions (this is from memory) about 50% of the applications work out of the box, about 25% require about a week worth of work (refactoring, adapting) another 15% require a serious commitment to redo chunks of your code, and the rest is just not worth bothering porting since they are so incredibly tied to Win32.   At that point, either you start from zero, or a business decision will drive the effort to make your code portable, but we are talking months worth of work (at least from the reports we have).</p>\n\n<p>If you are starting from scratch, the situation is a lot simpler, because you will only be using the APIs that are present in Mono.   As long as you stay with the supported stack (which is pretty much .NET 2.0, plus all the core upgrades in 3.5 including LINQ and System.Core, plus any of the Mono cross-platform APIs) you will be fine.  </p>\n\n<p>Every once in a while you might run into bugs in Mono or limitations, and you might have to work around them, but that is not different than any other system.</p>\n\n<p>As for portability: ASP.NET applications are the easier ones to port, as those have little to no dependencies on Win32 and you can even use SQL server or other popular databases (there are plenty of bundled database providers with Mono).   </p>\n\n<p>Windows.Forms porting is sometimes trickier because developers like to escape the .NET sandbox and P/Invoke their brains out to configure things as useful as the changing the cursor blinking rate expressed as two bezier points encoded in BCD form in a wParam.

In fact your current code does it very nicely, and Sven mentioned a good way to do it as well:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Get a list of all the files</li>\n<li>Check for \"required\" files</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>You would just have have add to your dictionary a list of required files:</p>\n\n<pre><code>checker = {\n  ...\n  'required': ['file', 'list', 'for_required']\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As far as there being a better/extensible way to do this?  I am not exactly sure.  I could only really think of a way to possibly drop the \"multiple\" regular expressions and build off of Sven's idea for using a delimiter.  So my strategy would be defining a dictionary as follows (and I'm sorry I don't know Python syntax and I'm a tad to lazy to look it up but it should make sense.  The /regex/ is shorthand for a regex):</p>\n\n<pre><code>check_dict = {\n  'delim'    : /\\-/,\n  'parts'    : [ 'Show Name', 'Episode Name', 'Episode Number' ],\n  'patterns' : [/valid name/, /valid episode name/, /valid number/ ],\n  'required' : ['list', 'of', 'files'],\n  'ignored'  : ['.*', 'hidden.txt'],\n  'start_dir': '/path/to/dir/to/test/'\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Split the filename based on the delimiter.</li>\n<li>Check each of the parts.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Because its an ordered list you can determine what parts are missing and if a section doesn't match any pattern it is malformed.  Here the <code>parts</code> and <code>patterns</code> have a 1 to 1 ratio.  Two arrays instead of a dictionary enforces the order.</p>\n\n<p>Ignored and required files can be listed.  The <code>.</code> and <code>..</code> files should probably be ignored automatically.  The user should be allowed to input \"globs\" which can be shell expanded.  I'm thinking here of <code>svn:ignore</code> properties, but globbing is natural for listing files.</p>\n\n<p>Here <code>start_dir</code> would be default to the current directory but if you wanted a single file to run automated testing of a bunch of directories this would be useful.</p>\n\n<p>The real loose end here is the path template and along the same lines what path is required for \"valid files\".  I really couldn't come up with a solid idea without writing one large regular expression and taking groups from it... to build a template.  It felt a lot like writing a TextMate language grammar.  But that starts to stray on the ease of use.  The real problem was that the path template was not composed of <code>parts</code>, which makes sense but adds complexity.</p>\n\n<p>Is this strategy in tune with what you were thinking of?</p>\n"}

{"prompt": "<p>I'm a complete Xcode/Objective-C/Cocoa newbie but I'm learning fast and really starting to enjoy getting to grips with a new language, platform and paradigm.</p>\n\n<p>One thing is though, having been using Visual Studio with R# for so long I've kind of been spoiled with the coding tools such as refactorings and completion etc and as far as I can tell Xcode has some fairly limited built in support for this stuff.</p>\n\n<p>On that note, does anyone know if any add-ins or whatever are available for the Xcode environment which add coding helpers such as automatically generating implementation skeletons from a class interface definition etc? </p>\n\n<p>I suspect there aren't but I suppose it can't help to ask.</p>\n", "completion": "<p>You sound as if you're looking for three major things: code templates, refactoring tools, and auto-completion.</p>\n\n<p>The good news is that Xcode 3 and later come with superb auto-completion and template support.  By default, you have to explicitly request completion by hitting the escape key.  (This actually works in all <code>NSTextView</code>s; try it!)  If you want to have the completions appear automatically, you can go to <strong>Preferences</strong> -> <strong>Code Sense</strong> and set the pop-up to appear automatically after a few seconds.  You should find good completions for C and Objective-C code, and pretty good completions for C++.</p>\n\n<p>Xcode also has a solid template/skeleton system that you can use.  You can see what templates are available by default by going to Edit -> Insert Text Macro.  Of course, you don't want to insert text macros with the mouse; that defeats the point.  Instead, you have two options:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Back in <strong>Preferences</strong>,go to <strong>Key Bindings</strong>, and then, under <strong>Menu Key Bindings</strong>, assign a specific shortcut to macros you use often.  I personally don't bother doing this, but I know plenty of great Mac devs who do</li>\n<li><p>Use the <code>CompletionPrefix</code>.  By default, nearly all of the templates have a special prefix that, if you type and then hit the escape key, will result in the template being inserted.  You can use Control-/ to move between the completion fields.</p>\n\n<p>You can see <a href=\"http://crookedspin.com/2005/06/10/xcode-macros/\">a full list of Xcode's default macros and their associated <code>CompletionPrefix</code>es</a> at <a href=\"http://crookedspin.com\">Crooked Spin</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You can also add your own macros, or modify the defaults.  To do so, edit the file <code>/Developer/Library/Xcode/Specifications/{C,HTML}.xctxtmacro</code>.  The syntax should be self-explanatory, if not terribly friendly.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, if you're addicted to R#, you will be disappointed by your refactoring options.  Basic refactoring is provided within Xcode through the context menu or by hitting Shift-Apple-J.  From there, you can extract and rename methods, promote and demote them through the class hierarchy, and a few other common operations.  Unfortunately, neither Xcode nor any third-party utilities offer anything approaching Resharper, so on that front, you're currently out of luck.  Thankfully, Apple has already demonstrated versions of Xcode in the works that have vastly improved refactoring capabilities, so hopefully you won't have to wait too long before the situation starts to improve.</p>\n"}

Else, add this attribute list definition to your code.</p>\n\n<p>Then modify your wxGLCanvas constructor to take this attribute list as a parameter:</p>\n\n<pre><code>myGLFrame::myGLFrame    // Derived from wxGLCanvas\n(\n    wxWindow *parent,\n    wxWindowID id,\n    const wxPoint&amp; pos,\n    const wxSize&amp; size,\n    long style,\n    const wxString&amp; name\n)\n: wxGLCanvas(parent, (wxGLCanvas*) NULL, id, pos, size, style, name, attribList)\n{\n    // ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>After the wxGLCanvas element is created, multisampling is turned on by default. To disable or enable it at will, use the related OpenGL calls:</p>\n\n<pre><code>glEnable(GL_MULTISAMPLE);\nglDisable(GL_MULTISAMPLE);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Multisampling should now work with the wxWidgets OpenGL program. Hopefully, it should be supported in the stable release of wxWidgets soon, making this information irrelevant :-)</p>\n"}

{"prompt": "<p>From what information I could find, they both solve the same problems - more esoteric operations like array containment and intersection (&amp;&amp;, @>, &lt;@, etc).

Then drop the index and do the same with a GIN index. Compare the values and you will have the answer you need, based on your data.</p>\n"}

If you don't want to do SSL on your whole site (maybe you have performance concerns), you might be able to get away with only SSL protecting the sensitive areas. To do that, first make sure your login page is HTTPS. When a user logs in, set a secure cookie (meaning the browser will only transmit it over an SSL link) in addition to the regular session cookie. Then, when a user visits one of your \"sensitive\" areas, redirect them to HTTPS, and check for the presence of that secure cookie.

Regularly change the serial num - maybe when the cookie is 5 minutes old and then reissue the cookie.  You could even reissue it on every page view if you wanted to. On the server side, keep a record of the last serial num you've issued for that session.

I can't give you the code off the top of my head (it would take a while to get it right without any compiler here on this PC), but I can point you in the right direction ...</p>\n\n<p>Let's use 8 dimensions (0-7) with indexes 0 to 3 as an example. You care about only 1,2 and 6. This means you have two arrays. First, <code>array_care[4][4][4]</code> for 1,2, and 6. The <code>array_care[4][4][4]</code> will hold the end result.</p>\n\n<p>Next, we want to iterate in a very specific way. We have the array <code>input[4][4][4][4][4][4][4][4]</code> to parse through, and we care about dimensions 1, 2, and 6.</p>\n\n<p>We need to define some temporary indexes:</p>\n\n<pre><code>int dim[8] = {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We also need to store the order in which we want to increase the indexes:</p>\n\n<pre><code>int increase_index_order[8] = {7,5,4,3,0,6,2,1};\nint i = 0;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This order is important for doing what you requested.</p>\n\n<p>Define a termination flag:</p>\n\n<pre><code>bool terminate=false;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now we can create our loop:</p>\n\n<pre><code>while (terminate)\n{\narray_care[dim[1]][dim[2]][dim[6]] += input[dim[0]][dim[1]][dim[2]][dim[3]][dim[4]][dim[5]][dim[6]][dim[7]];\n\nwhile ((dim[increase_index_order[i]] = 3) &amp;&amp; (i &lt; 8))\n{\ndim[increase_index_order[i]]=0;\ni++;\n}\n\nif (i &lt; 8) {\ndim[increase_index_order[i]]++; i=0;\n} else {\nterminate=true;\n}\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That should work for 8 dimensions, caring about 3 dimensions.

I want to get better at my hobby, which is all it is, as I am in high school.  Many of my posts regard implementing a genetic algorithm (This post, sparsearray, rank an array, pointer manipulation).</li>\n<li>I am using a sparse array representation, as it is possible to exceed the number of molecules in the universe using a traditional (dense) array.  For now, the implementation of the sparsearray itself doesnt matter a whole lot, as I am working to make it work with a standard array before going to a sparse representation.  For those who havent seen my previous questions, I am using a binary search tree as the structure to contain the sparse array points, and a \"driver\" function to traverse the tree as necessary, returning whatever the function is designed to do.  This is flexible, so I can accomodate a lot of different methods of accessing the array. </li>\n<li>The structure is a hypercube, and the number of dimensions is specified at run time, as well as the length of each dimension (which are all the same, as it is a hypercube).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Thanks everyone for your imput.</p>\n", "completion": "<p>This could have applications.

None of them are going to have their success rest on whether or not you use the \"this\" keyword to qualify access to fields. The this keyword will not help you ship on time. It's not going to reduce bugs, it's not going to have any appreciable effect on code quality or maintainability. It's not going to get you a raise, or allow you to spend less time at the office. </p>\n\n<p>It's really just a style issue. If you like \"this\", then use it. If you don't, then don't. If you need it to get correct semantics then use it. The truth is, every programmer has his own unique programing style. That style reflects that particular programmer's notions of what the \"most aesthetically pleasing code\" should look like. By definition, any other programmer who reads your code is going to have a different programing style. That means there is always going to be something you did that the other guy doesn't like, or would have done differently. At some point some guy is going to read your code and grumble about something. </p>\n\n<p>I wouldn't fret over it. I would just make sure the code is as aesthetically pleasing as possible according to your own tastes. If you ask 10 programmers how to format code, you are going to get about 15 different opinions. A better thing to focus on is how the code is factored. Are things abstracted right? Did I pick meaningful names for things? Is there a lot of code duplication? Are there ways I can simplify stuff? Getting those things right, I think, will have the greatest positive impact on your project, your code, your job, and your life. Coincidentally, it will probably also cause the other guy to grumble the least. If your code works, is easy to read, and is well factored, the other guy isn't going to be scrutinizing how you initialize fields. He's just going to use your code, marvel at it's greatness, and then move on to something else.</p>\n"}

The essence of OOP is that objects have knowledge and responsibility, can actually do things and cooperate with other classes.

How did you determine to use 300 record count chunks to insert?  SQL Server has a default packet size (I believe it is 4096 bytes) and it would make sense to me to derive the size of your records and ensure that you are making efficient use of the packets transmitting between client and server.  (Note, you can change your packet size on your client code as opposed to the server option which would obviously change it for all server communications - probably not a good idea.)  For instance, if your record size results in 300 record batches requiring 4500 bytes, you will send 2 packets with the second packet being mostly wasted.  If batch record count was arbitrarily assigned, it might make sense to do some quick easy math.</p>\n\n<p>From what I can tell (and remember about data type sizes) you have exactly 20 bytes for each record (if int=4 bytes and smallint=2 bytes).  If you are using 300 record count batches, then you are trying to send 300 x 20 = 6,000 bytes (plus I'm guessing a little overhead for the connection, etc).  You might be more efficient to send these up in 200 record count batches (200 x 20 = 4,000 + room for overhead) = 1 packet.  Then again, your bottleneck still appears to be the server's disk io.</p>\n\n<p>I realize you're comparing a raw data transfer to the SqlBulkCopy with the same hardware/configuration but here's where I would go also if the challenge was mine:</p>\n\n<p>This post probably won't help you anymore as it's rather old but I would next ask what your disk's RAID configuration is and what speed of disk are you using?  Try putting the log file on a drive that uses RAID 10 with a RAID 5 (ideally 1) on your data file.  This can help reduce a lot of spindle movement to different sectors on the disk and result in more time reading/writing instead of the unproductive \"moving\" state.  If you already separate your data and log files, do you have your index on a different physical disk drive from your data file (you can only do this with clustered indexes).  That would allow for not only concurrently updating logging information with data inserting but would allow index inserting (and any costly index page operations) to occur concurrently.</p>\n"}

However, there are a LOT of examples where OOP is misused and I think this is where the confusion comes in. </p>\n\n<p>Just because you can make something into an object does not mean you should. However, if doing so will make your code more organized/easier to read then you definitely should.</p>\n\n<p>A great practical example where OOP is very helpful is with a \"product\" class and objects that I use on our website. Since every page is a product, and every product has references to other products, it can get very confusing as to which product the data you have refers to. Is this \"strURL\" variable the link to the current page, or to the home page, or to the statistics page? Sure you could make all kinds of different variable that refer to the same information, but proCurrentPage->strURL, is much easier to understand (for a developer).</p>\n\n<p>In addition, attaching functions to those pages is much cleaner. I can do proCurrentPage->CleanCache(); Followed by proDisplayItem->RenderPromo(); If I just called those functions and had it assume the current data was available, who knows what kind of evil would occur. Also, if I had to pass the correct variables into those functions, I am back to the problem of having all kinds of variables for the different products laying around.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, using objects, all my product data and functions are nice and clean and easy to understand.</p>\n\n<p>However. The big problem with OOP is when somebody believes that EVERYTHING should be OOP. This creates a lot of problems. I have 88 tables in my database. I only have about 6 classes, and maybe I should have about 10. I definitely don't need 88 classes. Most of the time directly accessing those tables is perfectly understandable in the circumstances I use it, and OOP would actually make it more difficult/tedious to get to the core functionality of what is occurring.</p>\n\n<p>I believe a hybrid model of objects where useful and procedural where practical is the most effective method of coding. It's a shame we have all these religious wars where people advocate using one method at the expense of the others. They are both good, and they both have their place. Most of the time, there are uses for both methods in every larger project (In some smaller projects, a single object, or a few procedures may be all that you need).</p>\n"}

(e.g. using sealed on a c# class)\nRight now I can't think of any.</p>\n", "completion": "<p>I am in agreement with jjnguy... I think the reasons to seal a class are few and far between.  Quite the contrary, I have been in the situation more than once where I want to extend a class, but couldn't because it was sealed.</p>\n\n<p>As a perfect example, I was recently creating a small package (Java, not C#, but same principles) to wrap functionality around the memcached tool.  I wanted an interface so in tests I could mock away the memcached client API I was using, and also so we could switch clients if the need arose (there are 2 clients listed on the memcached homepage).  Additionally, I wanted to have the opportunity to replace the functionality altogether if the need or desire arose (such as if the memcached servers are down for some reason, we could potentially hot swap with a local cache implementation instead).</p>\n\n<p>I exposed a minimal interface to interact with the client API, and it would have been awesome to extend the client API class and then just add an implements clause with my new interface.  The methods that I had in the interface that matched the actual interface would then need no further details and so I wouldn't have to explicitly implement them.  However, the class was sealed, so I had to instead proxy calls to an internal reference to this class.  The result: more work and a lot more code for no real good reason.</p>\n\n<p>That said, I think there are potential times when you might want to make a class sealed... and the best thing I can think of is an API that you will invoke directly, but allow clients to implement.  For example, a game where you can program against the game... if your classes were not sealed, then the players who are adding features could potentially exploit the API to their advantage.  This is a very narrow case though, and I think any time you have full control over the codebase, there really is little if any reason to make a class sealed.</p>\n\n<p>This is one reason I really like the Ruby programming language... even the core classes are open, not just to extend but to ADD AND CHANGE functionality dynamically, TO THE CLASS ITSELF!  It's called monkeypatching and can be a nightmare if abused, but it's damn fun to play with!</p>\n"}

There can be semantics and relationships present that are easily broken by inheriting and overriding methods. Overriding one method at a time is an easy way to do this.  You design a class/object as a single meaningful entity and then someone comes along and thinks if a method or two were 'better' it would do no harm.  That may or may not be true.  Maybe you can correctly separate all methods between private and not private or virtual and not virtual but that still may not be enough. Demanding inheritance of all classes also puts a huge additional burden on the original developer to foresee all the ways an inheriting class could screw things up.<br />\nI don't know of a perfect solution. I'm sympathetic to preventing inheritance but that's also a problem because it hinders unit testing. </p>\n"}

I have an interface that says \"I perform this service.\"  I then have a class that implements that interface.  But, what if performing that service relies on context that the base class doesn't know about (and shouldn't know about)?  What happens is that the base class provides virtual methods, which are either protected or private, and these virtual methods are the hooks for subclasses to provide the piece of information or action that the base class does not know and cannot know.  Meanwhile, the base class can contain code that is common for all the child classes.  These subclasses would be sealed because they are meant to accomplish that one and only one concrete implementation of the service.</p>\n\n<p>Can you make the argument that these subclasses should be further subclassed to enhance them?  I would say no because if that subclass couldn't get the job done in the first place then it should never have derived from the base class.  If you don't like it then you have the original interface, go write your own implementation class.</p>\n\n<p>Sealing these subclasses also discourages deep levels of inheritence, which works well for GUI frameworks but works poorly for business logic layers.</p>\n"}

I once used TamTam SVN (<a href=\"http://www.daveswebsite.com/software/tamtamsvn/index.shtml\">http://www.daveswebsite.com/software/tamtamsvn/index.shtml</a>) with Visual Studio 2003, but stopped since I found it limiting.  Merging/branching/blaming, etc. are very powerful features Tortoise SVN provides that weren't in TamTam. Tigris also has <a href=\"http://svnvb6.tigris.org/\">http://svnvb6.tigris.org/</a>, but I have not tried it.</p>\n\n<p>Again, while you quite possibly get an IDE to work with VB6, I would not recommend it since the greatest strength of migrating to SVN is to break the Source Safe philosophy of check-in/check-out.</p>\n"}

This means that only one person can check the file out at a time.  By doing so, you will enforce that only one developer can modify these files at a time, and it is always clear who that person currently is.

Do not expect to much from JRuby's performance. In interpreted mode, it seems to be somewhere in the range of C Ruby. JIT mode <em>might</em> be faster, but only in theory. In practice, we tried JIT mode on Glassfish for a decently-sized Rails application on a medium-sized server (dual core, 8GB RAM).

Have all the exposed classes inherit from a common base class.  When accepting a handle to a function, first cast to the base class, then dynamic cast to the class you're expecting.  If they passed in a non-sensical handle, you'll get an exception when the run-time can't find the rtti.  If they passed in a valid handle of the wrong type, you get a NULL pointer and can throw your own exception.  If they passed in the correct pointer, you're good to go.\nThis isn't fool-proof, but it is certainly better at catching mistaken calls to the libraries than a straight reinterpret cast from a handle, and waiting until some data gets mysteriously corrupted when you pass the wrong handle in.</p>\n"}

That being said, being able to test software against specs is a Good Thing.</p>\n\n<p>Only your team can gauge the 'depth' of your tests, and that will probably be a function of how good your specs are. If they say something like, 'the login UI needs to provide a cancel button and a login button, and they need to work', your tests are going to be pretty general. But keep in mind - even very general tests are a Good Thing. Testing is a Good Thing. Too many developers have a bad attitude when it comes to testing, but at the end of the day, you're shipping software which should work, and to me, that means a lot.</p>\n\n<p>The effectiveness your tests will having in finding program faults will depend on the detail you put into them. What is especially nice about having test procedures written to specs is that you can test each build to the same level of detail as the previous build (typically referred to as a regression test).</p>\n"}

If you're not able to manipulate the server side to avoid sending a 401 response on failed credentials, then you will not be able to avoid this problem, because it's part of the (client-side) spec:</p>\n\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-XMLHttpRequest-20060619/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The XMLHttpRequest Object</a></h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If the UA supports HTTP Authentication [RFC2617] it SHOULD consider requests\n  originating from this object to be part of the protection space that includes the\n  accessed URIs and send Authorization  headers and handle 401 Unauthorised requests\n  appropriately. if authentication fails, UAs should prompt the users for credentials.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So the spec actually calls for the browser to prompt the user accordingly if any 401 response is received in an XMLHttpRequest, just as if the user had accessed the URL directly. As far as I can tell the only way to really avoid this would be for you to have control over the server side and cause 401 Unauthorized responses to be avoided, as Mark mentioned. </p>\n\n<p>One last thought is that you may be able to get around this using a proxy, such a separate server side script on another webserver. That script then takes a user and pass parameter and checks the authentication, so that the user's browser isn't what's making the original HTTP request and therefore isn't receiving the 401 response that's causing the prompt. If you do it this way you can find out from your \"proxy\" script if it failed, and if so then prompt the user again until it succeeds. On a successful authentication event, you can simply fetch the HTTP request as you are now, since everything works if the credentials are correctly specified.</p>\n"}

Create a \"database\" object that instead of returning  with results will return normal objects (i.e. will return <code>User</code> instead of a tuple <code>{name: \"marcin\", password: \"blah\"}</code>) write all your tests with ad hoc constructed <em>real</em> objects and write one big test that depends on a database that makes sure this conversion works OK.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Of course these approaches are not mutually exclusive and you can mix and match them as you need. </p>\n"}

Mocks are basically objects that look like the object you are trying to call a method on, in the sense that they have the same properties, methods, etc. available to caller.  But instead of performing whatever action they are programmed to do when a particular method is called, it skips that altogether, and just returns a result. That result is typically defined by you ahead of time.  </p>\n\n<p>In order to set up your objects for mocking, you probably need to use some sort of inversion of control/ dependency injection pattern, as in the following pseudo-code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Bar\n{\n    private FooDataProvider _dataProvider;\n\n    public instantiate(FooDataProvider dataProvider) {\n        _dataProvider = dataProvider;\n    }\n\n    public getAllFoos() {\n        // instead of calling Foo.GetAll() here, we are introducing an extra layer of abstraction\n        return _dataProvider.GetAllFoos();\n    }\n}\n\nclass FooDataProvider\n{\n    public Foo[] GetAllFoos() {\n        return Foo.GetAll();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now in your unit test, you create a mock of FooDataProvider, which allows you to call the method GetAllFoos without having to actually hit the database.</p>\n\n<pre><code>class BarTests\n{\n    public TestGetAllFoos() {\n        // here we set up our mock FooDataProvider\n        mockRepository = MockingFramework.new()\n        mockFooDataProvider = mockRepository.CreateMockOfType(FooDataProvider);\n\n        // create a new array of Foo objects\n        testFooArray = new Foo[] {Foo.new(), Foo.new(), Foo.new()}\n\n        // the next statement will cause testFooArray to be returned every time we call FooDAtaProvider.GetAllFoos,\n        // instead of calling to the database and returning whatever is in there\n        // ExpectCallTo and Returns are methods provided by our imaginary mocking framework\n        ExpectCallTo(mockFooDataProvider.GetAllFoos).Returns(testFooArray)\n\n        // now begins our actual unit test\n        testBar = new Bar(mockFooDataProvider)\n        baz = testBar.GetAllFoos()\n\n        // baz should now equal the testFooArray object we created earlier\n        Assert.AreEqual(3, baz.length)\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>A common mocking scenario, in a nutshell.  Of course you will still probably want to unit test your actual database calls too, for which you will need to hit the database.</p>\n"}

Will you need an easy, flexible way to do so? In other words, do you need Log4j's PatternLayout?</p>\n  \n  <p>Question Three :\n  Do you anticipate a definite need for the ability to change complex logging configurations in your applications, after they are compiled and deployed in a production environment? Does your configuration sound something like, \"Severe messages from this class get sent via e-mail to the support guy; severe messages from a subset of classes get logged to a syslog deamon on our server; warning messages from another subset of classes get logged to a file on network drive A; and then all messages from everywhere get logged to a file on network drive B\"? And do you see yourself tweaking it every couple of days?</p>\n  \n  <p>If you can answer yes to any of the above questions, go with Log4j. If you answer a definite no to all of them, JUL will be more than adequate and it's conveniently already included in the SDK.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That said, pretty much every project these days seems to wind up including log4j, if only because some other library uses it.</p>\n"}

The most difficult area to deal with is the model because the data does not persist throughout the application, and by nature the models seem to change on the client-side pretty consistently. You could standardize how you pass and receive data from the server, but then at that point the model does not really belong to JavaScript -- it belongs to your server-side application.</p>\n\n<p>I did see one attempt awhile back where someone created a framework for modeling data in JavaScript, much like the way SQLite belongs to the application. It was like Model.select( \"Product\" ) and Model.update( \"Product\", \"Some data...\" ). It was basically an object notation that held a bunch of data to manage the state of the current page. However, the minute you refresh, all that data is lost. I'm probably off on the syntax, but you get the point.</p>\n\n<p>If you are using jQuery, then Ben's approach is really the best. Extend the jQuery object with your functions and properties, and then compartmentalize your \"controllers\". I usually do this by putting them into separate source files, and loading them on a section-by-section basis. For instance, if it were an e-commerce site, I might have a JS file full of controllers that handle functionality for the checkout process. This tends to keep things lightweight and easy to manage.</p>\n"}

How do you detect them? How do you handle them? Finally, how do you prevent them from occurring?</p>\n", "completion": "<p>A race condition occurs when two or more threads can access shared data and they try to change it at the same time. Because the thread scheduling algorithm can swap between threads at any time, you don't know the order in which the threads will attempt to access the shared data. Therefore, the result of the change in data is dependent on the thread scheduling algorithm, i.e. both threads are \"racing\" to access/change the data. </p>\n\n<p>Problems often occur when one thread does a \"check-then-act\" (e.g. \"check\" if the value is X, then \"act\" to do something that depends on the value being X) and another thread does something to the value in between the \"check\" and the \"act\". E.g:</p>\n\n<pre><code>if (x == 5) // The \"Check\"\n{\n   y = x * 2; // The \"Act\"\n\n   // If another thread changed x in between \"if (x == 5)\" and \"y = x * 2\" above,\n   // y will not be equal to 10.\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The point being, y could be 10, or it could be anything, depending on whether another thread changed x in between the check and act. You have no real way of knowing.</p>\n\n<p>In order to prevent race conditions from occurring, you would typically put a lock around the shared data to ensure only one thread can access the data at a time. This would mean something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Obtain lock for x\nif (x == 5)\n{\n   y = x * 2; // Now, nothing can change x until the lock is released. \n              // Therefore y = 10\n}\n// release lock for x\n</code></pre>\n"}

How do you detect them? How do you handle them? Finally, how do you prevent them from occurring?</p>\n", "completion": "<p>Race conditions occur in multi-threaded applications or multi-process systems.  A race condition, at its most basic, is anything that makes the assumption that two things not in the same thread or process will happen in a particular order, without taking steps to ensure that they do.  This happens commonly when two threads are passing messages by setting and checking member variables of a class both can access.  There's almost always a race condition when one thread calls sleep to give another thread time to finish a task (unless that sleep is in a loop, with some checking mechanism).</p>\n\n<p>Tools for preventing race conditions are dependent on the language and OS, but some comon ones are mutexes, critical sections, and signals.  Mutexes are good when you want to make sure you're the only one doing something.  Signals are good when you want to make sure someone else has finished doing something.  Minimizing shared resources can also help prevent unexpected behaviors</p>\n\n<p>Detecting race conditions can be difficult, but there are a couple signs.  Code which relies heavily on sleeps is prone to race conditions, so first check for calls to sleep in the affected code.  Adding particularly long sleeps can also be used for debugging to try and force a particular order of events.  This can be useful for reproducing the behavior, seeing if you can make it disappear by changing the timing of things, and for testing solutions put in place.  The sleeps should be removed after debugging.</p>\n\n<p>The signature sign that one has a race condition though, is if there's an issue that only occurs intermittently on some machines.  Common bugs would be crashes and deadlocks.  With logging, you should be able to find the affected area and work back from there.</p>\n"}

Another thread can also retrieve the <b>same</b> value of x (because no thread has changed it yet) and then they would both be storing the <b>same</b> value (x+1) back in x!</p>\n\n<p>Example:</p>\n\n<pre>\nThread 1: reads x, value is 7\nThread 1: add 1 to x, value is now 8\nThread 2: reads x, <b>value is 7</b>\nThread 1: stores 8 in x\nThread 2: adds 1 to x, value is now 8\nThread 2: <b>stores 8 in x</b>\n</pre>\n\n<p>Race conditions can be avoided by employing some sort of <b>locking</b> mechanism before the code that accesses the shared resource:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-c prettyprint-override\"><code>for ( int i = 0; i &lt; 10000000; i++ )\n{\n   //lock x\n   x = x + 1; \n   //unlock x\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here, the answer comes out as 50,000,000 every time.</p>\n\n<p>For more on locking, search for: mutex, semaphore, critical section, shared resource.</p>\n"}

In the end I used similar code to the following (from Chris):</p>\n\n<pre><code>open (FILE, '&gt;&gt;', test.dat') ; # open the file \nflock FILE, 2; # try to lock the file \n# do something with the file here \nclose(FILE); # close the file\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In his example I removed the flock FILE, 8 as the close(FILE) performs this action as well. The real problem was when the script starts it has to hold the current counter, and when it ends it has to update the counter. This is where Perl has a problem, to read the file you:</p>\n\n<pre><code> open (FILE, '&lt;', test.dat');\n flock FILE, 2;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now I want to write out the results and since i want to overwrite the file I need to reopen and truncate which results in the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code> open (FILE, '&gt;', test.dat'); #single arrow truncates double appends\n flock FILE, 2;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In this case the file is actually unlocked for a short period of time while the file is reopened. This demonstrates the case for the external lock file. If you are going to be changing contexts of the file, use a lock file. The modified code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>open (LOCK_FILE, '&lt;', test.dat.lock') or die \"Could not obtain lock\";\nflock LOCK_FILE, 2;\nopen (FILE, '&lt;', test.dat') or die \"Could not open file\";\n# read file\n# ...\nopen (FILE, '&gt;', test.dat') or die \"Could not reopen file\";\n#write file\nclose (FILE);\nclose (LOCK_FILE);\n</code></pre>\n"}

The term itself is stolen from software languages -- for example, C has the \"auto\" keyword for declaring variables as being allocated on the stack when the scope it's in is executed, and deallocated afterwards, so that multiple invocations of the same scope do not see persistent values of that variable.  The reason you may not have heard of this keyword in C is that it is the default storage class for all types :-)  The alternatives are \"static\", which means \"allocate this variable statically (to a single global location in memory), and refer to this same memory location throughout the execution of the program, regardless of how many times the function is invoked\", and \"volatile\", which means \"this is a register elsewhere on my SoC or something on another device which I have no control over; compiler, please don't optimize reads to me away, even when you think you know my value from previous reads with no intermediate writes in the code\".</p>\n\n<p>\"automatic\" is intended for recursive functions, but also for running the same function in different threads of execution concurrently.  For instance, if you \"fork\" off N different blocks (using Verilog's fork->join statement), and have them all call the same function at the same time, the same problems arise as a function calling itself recursively.</p>\n\n<p>In many cases, your code will be just fine without declaring the task or function as \"automatic\", but it's good practice to put it in there unless you specifically need it to be otherwise.</p>\n"}

For some reason I had to set the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable before it would even run on any of the app code, and the documentation is very sparse.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>pyflakes</strong>: 'pyflakes --help' throws a TypeError -- erm... Documentation is also very sparse, and pyflakes is very forgiving (as far as I can tell, it only reports compile errors, warnings, redefinitions, and some concerns about imports--such as unused and wildcards).  pyflakes also seems to repeat itself:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>eventlist/views.py:4: 'Http404' imported but unused<br>\n      eventlist/views.py:4: 'Http404' imported but unused<br>\n      eventlist/views.py:5: 'from eventlist.models import *' used; unable to detect undefined names\n      eventlist/views.py:59: 'authenticate' imported but unused<br>\n      eventlist/views.py:61: redefinition of unused 'login' from\n  line 59<br>\n      eventlist/views.py:5: 'from eventlist.models import *' used;\n  unable to detect undefined names <br>\n     eventlist/views.py:4: 'Http404' imported but unused</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n<li><p><strong>pylint</strong>: This seems to be the most capable of the tools suggested.  It has the best documentation.  LogiLab provides a tutorial, pylint has a help screen, and there is a (broken) link to a user manual, which would be extremely helpful.  There are some issues with applying pylint to django, since pylint doesn't know about the django classes (such as models.Model).

And as far as creating a cross-distribution Linux binary, 32-bit POSIX/X11 would probably be the safest bet. I'm not sure what JungleDisk uses as I'm currently on a Mac.</p>\n"}

We ended up abstracting out into dedicated source files any routine that was not consistent across platforms, and used #defines where appropriate in those source files.  This kept the code that was adjusted per platform isolated away from the main business logic of the library.  We also made extensive use of typedefs and our own dedicated types so that we could easily change them per platform if needed.  This made the port to 64-bit platforms fairly easy.</p>\n\n<p>If you are looking to have GUI components, I would suggest looking at GUI toolkits such as WxWindows or Qt (which are both C++ libraries).</p>\n"}

{"prompt": "<p>Is there a recommendation for a hardware platform for developing/testing SideShow devices, or is the Emulator adequate?</p>\n", "completion": "<p>I'm not really sure about sideshow in particular. But since sideshow uses the microframework I could give you my view on that.\nFor just getting started the emulator is very good. You're going to use the emulator during development most of the time anyway so if you're just figuring things out it is fine to use just that. You can also tweak the emulator to emulate the specific hardware you want to use (add io ports etc.) so if you're not clear on what you want to do or what you need this is a good way to try stuff out.</p>\n\n<p>If you know exactly what you want to build it might be a good idea to think about what hardware you're going to need as soon as possible. There are some developer boards out there for the microframework that you might use for sideshow. Or if you've got specific needs you might end up developing your own hardware and porting the microframework to it. I don't really know what you need so I can't recommend a specific hardware platform. There are some examples on the microsoft microframework site that you might want to look at. <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/embedded/bb267253.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/embedded/bb267253.aspx</a> look under the heading developer kits.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this is usefull for you.</p>\n"}

But instead of making a rectangular grid, you can choose dividing lines that closely match the lines of the Voronoi diagram (this way you will get fewer areas that cross dividing lines). If you recursively divide your Voronoi diagram in half along the best dividing line for each subdiagram, you can then do a tree search for each point you want to look up. This requires a bit of work up front but saves time later. Each lookup would be on the order of log N where N is the number of points. 16 comparisons is a lot better than 15,000!</p>\n"}

If you're doing it a thousand times on a server, constructing a bitmap lookup table would be faster, either giving the result directly or as a first stage of. 2GB of bitmap can map the whole world lat-lon to a 32bit value at 0.011 degree pixels (1.2km at equator), and should fit into memory. If you're only doing single country, or can exclude the poles, you can have a smaller map or higher resolution. For 15,000 points you probably have a much smaller map - I first sized it up as a first step to doing lat-lon to postcode searches, which needs higher resolution. Depending on requirements, you use the mapped value to point at the result directly, or to short list of the candidates (which would allow a smaller map, but requires greater subsequent processing - you're not in O(1) lookup territory any more). </p>\n"}
